    "The CBoW model has been implemented to run through command line with the following flags used in the run below: \n",
    "* *-train* and *-val* is the path to the training and validation data, respectively. \n",
    "* *-d* needs a string denoting the direction of the text window, which can be 'before', 'after' or 'both' for the models $p\\left(y_t|y_{t-c}\\right)$, $p\\left(y_t|y_{t+c}\\right)$ and $p\\left(y_t|y_{t-c}^{t+c}\\right)$, respectively. \n",
    "* *-pad* will store True and enable padding to be used in the model. \n",
    "* *-ws* is an integer and sets the window size, $c$. \n",
    "* *-embed* is an integer that sets the number of embedding dimensions. \n",
    "* *-b* is an integer that sets the batch size. \n",
    "* *-lr* needs a float and sets the learning rate for the model. \n",
    "* *-e* is an integer and sets the number of iterations or epochs for the model to run. \n",
    "* *-f* requires a string that will be used as postfix for all output files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional option flags include: \n",
    "* *-r* is the path to a saved checkpoint of the model, which enables resuming training. \n",
    "* *-test* is the path to the test data and this flag activates the test run of the model. This requires that *-r* has also been set. \n",
    "* *-tsne*, stores True and enables making a t-SNE visualization of the tested model. This requires both *-r* and *-test* have been set. "
